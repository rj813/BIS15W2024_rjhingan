```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

You will need the tidyverse to complete the warm-up- be sure to load the library.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

1. Load the fish data. 

```{r}
setwd("/Users/rjhingan/Desktop/BIS15W2024_rjhingan/lab5")
```

```{r}
fish <- read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

2. Transform the fish data to only include the variables lakeid and length.  Store this as a new dataframe called "fishlength".   

```{r}
fishlength <- select(fish, "lakeid", "length")
```

3. Filter the `fish` data to include the samples from lake "BO".  

```{r}
glimpse(fish)
```

```{r}
fishBO <- filter(fish, lakeid == "BO")
```

4. Calculate the mean length of fish from lake "BO".  

```{r}
fishBO_mean <- mean(fishBO$length)
```
